			My nick is Timmy Anderson. I took it after the main character of my first book DeltaMK3. I'm in my mid 40ties and live in the eastern Slovakian city Kosice. I work as a programmer and my main hobby is studying IT books and writing fiction books. On the first link you can find annotations to my fiction books written in my native language Slovak. One of books is downloadable. There is also a link to my repository with more than 1000 samples I created while studying those IT books. The last link points to my repository with a simple C++ library I created.
