			<span>This page contains some of IT books I have studied during my 20+ years career as a programmer. When studying IT books I always try to create useful code samples that serve as a cookbook when I need to use or understand some feature. All of these code samples are my personal work, not the downloaded samples from associated book web pages. The comments and remarks are written in my native language Slovak. All source codes are available on the GITHUB.</span>

					<td>A quite interesting book about advanced debugging techniques in .NET that go far beyond 'standard' debugging tools in Visual Studio. Normally you don't need to use these techniques but in some cases post mortem debugging, doing COM interoperability, or having problems with memory (Large Object Heap is not defragmented in .NET), techniques presented in this book are being very helpful.</td>

					<td>The book from legendary author Charles Petzold well known for his Win32 API programming book about WPF. The book provides unique way for explanation of WPF. First half of the book is all about C# code. No XAML at all. It shows you WPF programming model that is independent to XAML. The second part of book is all about XMAL. It teaches you how to create static and dynamic forms only in XAML. Since WPF is a part of .NET Core, it's an evolving technology that allows you to create non-web GUI application under Windows, Linux or MacOS.</td>

						<td>CLR via C#, 4th Edition is by far the most comprehensive and deepest explanation how C# and CLR works. It gives you a lot of insights how the CLR works. There is also a large section about multithreading and task programming with one of the best explanation of how thread, tasks and synchronization primitives work. Jeffrey Richter as a seasoned expert in Windows technologies provides a unique, clear and easy to understand the CLR and C#. It is a must read for every C# developer. The book was written for .NET Framework but it is perfectly valid for .NET Core. I consider CLR via C# as the best book that has been written about the CLR and C#.</td>

I believe that most .NET programmers never ever write any code in MSIL since C# and other languages are must easier to use. But if you like to delve deep into technology and how it works this book does a good job. CLR also offers a few features that are not supported in C# and can be accessed only via MSIL. A newer edition of this book is available.</td>
