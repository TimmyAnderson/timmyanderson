		<h1>IT BOOKS</h1>
		<section class="MY_IT_BOOK_INTRODUCTION_DIV">
			<span>The page contains some of IT books I have studied during my 20+ years career as a programmer. When studying IT books I always try to create useful code samples that serve as a cookbook when I need to use or understand some feature. All of these code samples are my personal work, not the downloaded samples from associated book web pages. The comments and remarks are written in my native language Slovak. All source codes are available on the GITHUB.</span>

						<th>Review:</th>
						<td>CLR via C#, 4th Edition is by far the most comprehensive and deepest explanation how C# and CLR works. It gives you a lot of insights how the CLR works. There is also a large section about multithreading and task programming with one of the best explanation of how thread, tasks and synchronization primitives work. Jeffrey Richter as a seasoned expert in Windows technologies provides a unique, clear and easy to understand the CLR and C#. It is a must read for every C# developer. The book was written for .NET Framework but it is perfectly valid for .NET Core. I consider CLR via C# as the best book that has been written about the CLR and C#.</td>

						<td>Excelent introduction into construction of compilers. The books describies frontend and backend part of compilers like scaners, expression trees, parsers, semantic analyzers, runtime environments and code optimization. Using solely this book I was able to implement my own trivial programming language in pure C# without using tools like YACC or BISON.</td>
