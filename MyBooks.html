					<h3>DeltaMK3</h3>
				</div>

				<p>
					<span>
						Timothy Anderson (my alter ego) is 12 years old troubled boy from Minneapolis. Bullied by schoolmates, lonely, not having any friends he longs for, with parents who are always busy, he things he is a real loser. What Tim doesn't know, he is a part of top secret plan of 'galactic' proportions.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						The book starts when a new schoolmate named Ateryu (*) joins Tim's class and Atreyu sits next to him. Even Atreyu is kind to Tim, Tim is reluctant to make friendship with him since he is a true opposite of Tim. Atreyu is a handsome, popular, gifted and well educated and Tim believes that soon or later Atreyu joins the rest of his class and starts bullying him. Only after Atreyu saves Tim from 3 class bullies who beats Tim badly, their friendship come true.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						But Tim faces a serious problem. Strange things start to happen. His glass bottle that was broken to pieces by one of class bully is miraculously glued together as it was never broken. At the school pool Tim is chased be invisible object he can hear only and see it just in the reflection of the pool water. One night Tim is attacked by a creature similar to Alien's facehugger. In the past Tim had some mental problems, so he is not quite sure if these things are real or just a product of his vivid imagination. And he is afraid to tell about it to his parents since he believes he will be locked to a psychiatric hospital. After a while he decides to tell it to his best and only friend Atreyu.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						Atreyu feels sorry for Tim and admits that it's his fault. According to his words, Atreyu even he is just 12, he is an agent of top secret organization called XCOM fighting against the planned alien invasion that has already started. Atreyu believes that making a friendship with Tim forces aliens to investigate his new friend. Atreyu offers Tim to join the organization what Tim eagerly accepts.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						Tim and Atreyu start their fight against the aliens that must be kept in absolute secret. They go to 'missions' how Atreyu calls them, where they destroy UFO, enter secret alien base (masked as an old shack) where they found alien embryos, go to cave where they are attacked by an alien and many other things. Tim's life is now totally different and even facing all those dangers he is happy for the first time in his life.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						But not everything goes according to the plan. Atreyu doesn't want to show Tim secret XCOM base, nor any other XCOM agents. Many missions look strange. Crashed UFO doesn't leave any wreckage, embryos and adult alien look like they are just a product of some kind of hologram and so on. What's more, Atreyu lives in a strange house with its own supercomputer and observatory. Slowly, Tim starts to doubt if Atreyu is telling him truth and if Atreyu himself is not one of those evil aliens. His suspicion confirms when Tim enters his friend's yard and Atreyu's house protected by some kind of force field shows its real appearance. Now it looks like a hyper-futuristic base with a spaceship hovering over the yard and robots that start to chase Tim. Escaping robots, Time runs always. Absolutely sure his former friend Atreyu is the real alien Tim must start to fight for his own life. But the reality is more complex than it might look like.

						<i>* Atreyu is a temporary name I'll change in the final version of the book. It's my homage to movie The Neverending Story that I loved as a child so much that it made me to start writing. I was 8 or 9.</i>

						<b>The book isn't finished yet. Text is completed but since I was writing it in time span of 15 years a huge amount of rewriting is needed to make the text more readable. And since the book has 1,700 norm pages (1,800 characters per page) it will take years to finish it.</b>

					<h3>Josh was here - diary of a dying boy</h3>
				</div>

				<p>
					<span>
						Josh Hurt (my alter ego) is 12 years old boy from Boston. Just lives with his mother, father and younger sister Emily in Jamaica Plain suburb. He is a clever and well behaved guy with a good heart (*). It's a summer time and summer holiday just started but Josh is sad and envious of other kids who are playing baseball outside. He studied hard at the school at got all A grades, but now his long awaited summer holiday is going to be ruined. Josh contracted an acute lymphoblastic leukemia and he goes to the Boston Children Hospital to be treated there.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						Josh in his diary starts to describe painful and exhausting treatment he has to undergo. And even cancer ward is not the nicest place in the world, Josh meets new friends there. Jesse is 12 years old who always have crazy ideas like secretly visiting the hospital morgue. Mike is a teenager and computer genius who remains sarcastic though his condition is very serious. Jen 13 years old is a leukemia survivor who is just finishing her treatment and soon she leaves the hospital.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						Besides all the terrible things like vomiting after chemotherapy, undergoing chest catheter operation or intrathecal chemotherapy administered to a spinal chord, Josh is happy. He has new cool friends and beautiful Jen he fall in love with. Unfortunately, Josh is too shy to express his feelings towards Jen. And Josh is running out of time. Jen is going to be released and a farewell party is his last opportunity to tell her how he loves her. Taking his last chance Josh doesn't tell his favorite nurse Julia about his increasing pain in the chest being afraid not to be admitted to a farewell party. With too many people there including all kids from the cancer ward, doctors and nurses, Josh could not find a minute to be alone with Jen. Everything is in vain. Josh will never express Jen how he loves her.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						But there is a new hope. Jess came with the idea of after-party at night. Josh, Jess, Mike and Jen go to a hospital roof watching stars. Josh as an enthusiastic astronomer and space ship geek shows his friends all constellations he can find and they watch falling meteoroid. A beautiful night ends when Josh starts to cough. Jen decides to go back to hospital rooms. Accompanying Josh, both go to his room. Now, Josh has his last opportunity to tell Jen how he loves he. Still hesitating, out of nothing it's Jen who asks Josh if she can become his girlfriend. Josh is now the happiest boy in the world. He loves Jen and Jen loves him.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						Their happiness doesn't last long. In the morning Josh's condition deteriorates rapidly as he contracted a serious pneumonia. He is taken to an intensive care unit where he fights for his life. His weakened body with poor immunity almost doesn't make it. Fortunately, his condition slowly starts to improve and after several weeks spent at ICU he is moved back to the cancer ward. Josh is alone there. Mike was moved to NYC for experimental treatment, Josh was released for several weeks before he starts a new chemotherapy cycle and Jen as a cancer survivor was released home to her father farm in Natick, MA. Chatting with Jen is Josh's only joy and hope.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						Because of pneumonia, doctors should stopped administering chemotherapy and chemotherapy cycle must start again. Brining all nauseas and other troubles, it is much easier now for Josh, since he knows Jen loves him. Her love makes him stronger and helping him to overcome his sadness when Josh learns that his friend Mike died. Released from hospital a few weeks later, he finally meets Jen and Jess. Jess didn't answer Josh's chats and emails for a long time out of depression. Jess's treatment has failed and his only chance is a risky bone marrow transplant. But Josh condition is not better. His bone marrow tests show that Josh treatment failed too. And when Jess died of a disease caused by his poor immunity only Josh and Jen remain. Josh is dying and their love must face the final challenge.

						<i>The book is inspired by the movie <b>Ways to Live Forever (2010)</b> about 12 years old Sam, who is dying from leukemia. While the movie is nice, I wanted to put more stress on feelings of my main character Josh, so the book is written as a diary using first person narrative. There is also a strong Christian motif at the end of book.</i>
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>
						<i>* I took a name Josh after the movie character <b>Josh Waitzkin</b> from the beautiful and touching movie <b>Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993)</b>. Josh Waitzkin is portrayed as a 7 years old chess prodigy how is also a goodhearted boy that doesn't want to win his chess matches at all cost.</i>
